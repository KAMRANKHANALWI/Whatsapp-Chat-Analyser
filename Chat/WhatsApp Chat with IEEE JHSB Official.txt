01/08/22, 3:27 pm - +91 88001 58396: Yes
01/08/22, 3:28 pm - Zoheb Bhai JH: Cool, how about you get the updates of the meeting from me? Jab tak 10 baje ho rahi hain meetings.
01/08/22, 3:30 pm - +91 88001 58396: Yes that will be fine but please change the time of next meets
01/08/22, 3:30 pm - Zoheb Bhai JH: Sure. We'll discuss with everyone.
01/08/22, 3:33 pm - Maheen⁷ Appi IEEE: Listen @918800158396, the way u r talking is very disrespectful.. We r a professional team not some group of friends, just because we talk friendly doesnt mean u can go ahead and make silly assumptions and disrespect the team. The timing was decided mutually by all "regular" members. If u have issues with the time talk to members and come up with a better timing which is suited for the majority

Also, about talking to maam, please do, its ur right, after all we update her about everything and everyone's behaviour as well :)
01/08/22, 3:35 pm - +91 88001 58396: @918409406329 i already informed Abdullah about the change of timing long ago and he still didn't responded to it. And as there is information provided before also about what happened in meet.
01/08/22, 3:36 pm - +91 88001 58396: @918409406329 and why are you sending msg on his behalf? I tagged him at start not you
01/08/22, 3:36 pm - Maheen⁷ Appi IEEE: Thats because u were the only one having issue with the time rupam

We have to go with the majority thats how it works
01/08/22, 3:37 pm - Zoheb Bhai JH: Just like you aren't free at 10 pm he might not be free right now
01/08/22, 3:37 pm - +91 88001 58396: But taking meet at night is not professional at all
01/08/22, 3:37 pm - +91 95600 58967: Clearly u have never worked anywhere
01/08/22, 3:37 pm - Maheen⁷ Appi IEEE: Because im the chairperson as well, when he is not available im the one who has to look after things.. I dont need to explain my work to u
01/08/22, 3:37 pm - Shadman Khan Alwi: Hain!!
01/08/22, 3:38 pm - Maheen⁷ Appi IEEE: Where did u get that from? What abt the organizations that run evening shifts?
01/08/22, 3:38 pm - +91 88001 58396: The only thing is i asked to change the time to early.
01/08/22, 3:38 pm - +91 88001 58396: Nothing more
01/08/22, 3:40 pm - Abdullah Bhai JH Senior changed this group's settings to allow only admins to send messages to this group
01/08/22, 3:38 pm - Aabiyah Zehra IEEE: she's actually doing her work :)
01/08/22, 3:38 pm - +91 88001 58396: You are set stone on it?
01/08/22, 3:38 pm - Aabiyah Zehra IEEE: toh tum akele meet attend karoge?
01/08/22, 3:38 pm - Shadman Khan Alwi: Bhai office todhe hi h professional time shift ho sakta h tum waqt batao sb free honge ho jaye ga
01/08/22, 3:39 pm - Maheen⁷ Appi IEEE: The only thing i ask is Please talk to the members and come up with the better time

Nothing more :)
01/08/22, 3:39 pm - Maheen⁷ Appi IEEE: End of the topic everyone please stop making arguments in the group now
01/08/22, 3:39 pm - Zoheb Bhai JH: And you were being disrespectful
01/08/22, 3:43 pm - Abdullah Bhai JH Senior changed this group's settings to allow all members to send messages to this group
01/08/22, 3:55 pm - Maheen⁷ Appi IEEE: Alright everything is cool now

Guidelines for this Competition: 
Student Branches, under the aegis of the IEEE Delhi Section, have the opportunity to display intriguing projects undertaken by their student members on the IEEE DSSYWC'22 stage.
Each Student Branch will be given an area to present their projects. They can embellish their allotted spot with banners, and unique approaches within the guidelines are all encouraged.
Only one entry in the registration form would be allowed by a Student Branch.
It is recommended that the Student Branch Chairperson/Vice-Chairperson are nominated as the Team Lead. However, in case of their unavailability, a volunteer from the Student Branch, who is an active IEEE Member, can also represent the Student Branch as the Team Lead.

Even if you don't make any attempts to create a personal brand, it already exists if you are active online.

IEEE Week 7.0 brings to you 'Becoming a CEO as an Engineer’ ✨
So hop onto our online session with our speaker being none other than Mr. Tanay Pratap!

Mr. Tanay Pratap founded INVACT METAVERSITY last year, a company that provides high-quality and virtually immersive learning experiences to its user at an affordable price.
He had worked as a full-time software engineer for tech giants like - Microsoft, Artifacia, Cisco, and Cypress Semiconductor.

By gaining enlightenment from a person with such rich experiences you build a strong personal brand and enrich your aura in this virtual world.

22/03/23, 4:22 pm - Maheen⁷ Appi IEEE: Greetings! 

Girl Up Hamdard invites you to attend -We Care, Period: Empowerment Workshop organized by Girl Up India. 
*Date: March 23*, *Thursday*
*Time: 2:00 - 4:00 PM*
*Venue: LT-16*,*Central Library Building*,*ground floor*, *Jamia Hamdard University*

The event, being hosted by Girl Up India is a part of their partnership with Vee Kativhu, for menstrual equity campaign, 'We Care, Period'.

*About We Care, Period.*
At the onset of menarche, at least 23 million girls in India drop out of school annually. This is because 1 in 10 girls under 21 cannot afford safe, sanitary products to manage their periods. Coupled with a lack of awareness, 88% of women in India use unhygienic alternatives like ash, hay or old rags. To help continue their education and provide access to safe period products, Girl Up India, in collaboration with Empowered by Vee, is launching a fundraising campaign 'We Care, Period'. The Campaign helps Girl Up India and Empowered by Vee to support and empower a community of girls for one year. 
*About Vee Kativhu*
Vee Kativhu is a 23-year-old author, YouTube visionary, education activist and founder of the youth empowerment organization, Empowered by Vee. A graduate of both Oxford and Harvard Universities, Vee has been named a Diana Award Legacy Award Recipient, a United Kingdom Rare Rising Star, a Future Leader and The Vice Chancellor’s Diversity Champion. Vee is raising funds for Girl Up India’s menstrual equity campaign by organizing and hosting an Empowerment Brunch on March 4 in London and a global 5K run on March 18. Vee will be joining us in India in for the Empowerment Workshop. 

*About the Empowerment Workshop by Vee *
The empowerment workshop is a skill based workshop that teaches young people tools that are often “immeasurable” such as ‘how to deal with rejection, how to fight imposter syndrome, and how to set goals you can actually achieve” - all of it is centred around the academic lense and helps students navigate their academic journeys with courage and confidence. The workshop will be led by Vee Kativhu and followed by an informal meet and greet with all attendees.

Limited number of seats available.Interested students can contact:

Just a quick reminder that we have a meeting scheduled for *today at 10 p.m.*
The meeting will be held on *Google Meet* Please make sure to join on time.

The purpose of this meeting is to provide an opportunity for *new members to interact with old members* and get to know each other. We believe that this will help to build a sense of community within the student branch and encourage collaboration.

In addition, we will be discussing the distribution of *IEEE JHSB work among members.* This will be an important topic, as it will help us to ensure that all members are contributing to the student branch's goals and objectives.

*It is important that all members attend the meeting, as we value your input and participation in the society.*

*If you are unable to attend the meeting, please inform us in advance.*
Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to seeing you all at the meeting.

Everyone who is interested in writing for IEEE JHSB’s website please note that if your articles get enough interaction on the website, they might also get published in MindSpark this year. Make sure to write very interesting ones as they will for sure make it into the magazine!

Apart from tech related articles, we will also have a miscellaneous section (that will not be on the website, just the magazine). If anyone is interested in writing articles for the same, please do let me or @917982364112 know!  

There is no specific deadline for these yet, we will keep taking submissions until it’s time to finalise the magazine (which is tentatively sometime in October). 

Good luck! 💞

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. On behalf of the Former Chairperson and the entire Former senior executive committee of the *IEEE JHSB*, I would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations to all those who organized the remarkable farewell party for us.

The farewell party served as a memorable and befitting tribute to our time together, highlighting the dedication, teamwork, and enthusiasm that have characterized our journey as an *IEEE JHSB* family. It was a wonderful occasion to reflect upon our achievements, honour the outgoing members, and celebrate the remarkable milestones we have attained throughout our tenure.

We express our deepest gratitude to the organizing committee, whose unwavering commitment and meticulous planning ensured that the event was a resounding success. Your tireless efforts in creating a warm and congenial atmosphere for all attendees truly showcased the spirit of IEEE JHSB, and we are immensely grateful for your exceptional work.

Furthermore, as we bid farewell to our outgoing members, it is also a time of renewal and opportunity. We warmly welcome and congratulate the new members of the senior executive committee and the junior executive committee, who have assumed their respective posts. You have now taken up the mantle of responsibility to lead IEEE JHSB forward, and we have the utmost confidence in your abilities to uphold the values of excellence and innovation that our organization stands for.

To the new members of the Senior Executive Committee (2023-24), we trust that your experience, knowledge, and leadership will guide IEEE JHSB towards new horizons of success. Your vision and strategic thinking will play a crucial role in fostering growth and advancing our technical initiatives while ensuring a nurturing environment for our members to learn, collaborate, and excel.

To the new members of the Junior executive committee(2023-24), your dedication, enthusiasm, and fresh perspectives are the driving force that propels IEEE JHSB towards greatness. We encourage you to embrace this opportunity to make a lasting impact, supporting the senior executive committee in their endeavours and promoting a culture of innovation and inclusivity among our members.

Once again, congratulations to the *organizing committee* for the successful farewell party, and a warm welcome to the new members of the senior and junior executive committees. May your tenure be filled with fulfilment, growth, and remarkable achievements.

With best wishes,

26/05/23, 11:51 pm - Maheen⁷ Appi IEEE: Hey Everyone, first of all thanks u guys for the amazing farewell party, u guys put in so much effort and detail into every little thing, that was really heartwarming, thank u so much guys, really.

I am so happy to see u all working together to make great things happen. I hope iss saal bhi u guys have a great bond like we did. I hope u guys meet people who will change ur life and u guys achieve great milestones together. I hope ur time at IEEE becomes one of ur favorite moments in hamdard like it did for me. I hope guys work together and take IEEE higher and we go from the top 3 student branch to the best student branch and I really do see it coming with the new execom InshaAllah!

But above all i wanna tell u all how proud I am of each one of u, of our team, of our new execom, like i cant stress that enough, like what i said today ki fark ni padta if tumlog bus 1-2 saal chote ho mujhse ya maybe there r juniors who r older than me as well, but IEEE members r my bacche and that's how i have cherished them throughout the year. 

Some of u were here from the very beginning and some of u came a little late but from the delhi section conference to technozova to today's farewell party today, we had a blast and i will always have the corners of this page folded in the story of my life.

All the very best to u all, I'll always be so proud of u guys and I expect nothing but the best from this gen. I might not be here in college anymore but im always there in case any of u needs any guidance, please come to me without any hesitation.

So i guess thats it. It's me, Maheen Ashraf officially signing off. It has been a honor to be a part of the team, thank u for having me here :)

Lots of love and best wishes,

Maheen Ashraf
